## Kind of Research
### Focus of the lab would be (Technology/Analytical techniques to be used)
1. Understanding how wild grapes and downy mildew oomycete coevolve, cultivated grapes (vineyards) will be kept in the context.
	- Genomics (DNA/RNA: long read, short reads)
	- Plant Pathology (host-microbe interactions)
	- Population genetics and genomics (demography, selection, mutation, recombination)
	- Landscape genomics and ecology (adaptation to niches, development of sampling schemes)

2. Leveraging this knowledge to build predictive modeling of emergence of new virulence in wild and cultivated grapes.

### Technology/Analytical techniques to be used:
1. Following subdisciplines
	- Genomics (DNA/RNA: long read, short reads)
	- Plant Pathology (host-microbe interactions)
	- Population genetics and genomics (demography, selection, mutation, recombination)
	- Landscape genomics and ecology (adaptation to niches, development of sampling schemes)

2. Computational biology and mathematics
	- Simulation of the populations (SLiM) for host-pathogen dynamics
	- Graphs, networks for the genome evolution (pangenome, network analysis)	
	- Machine learning (Bayesian Networks, Transformers)
	- Category theory
