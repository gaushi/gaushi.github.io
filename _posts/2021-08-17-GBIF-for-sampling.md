# Utility of Global Biodiversity Information Facility for Organizing Sampling Trips



Sampling for the infected host is slightly complicated than lets say if you are sampling for the host alone. This gets even trickier when it comes to the sampling for the pathogen that is obligate biotroph like *Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis* (downy mildew disease causing oomycete of *Arabidopsis thaliana*.

Phenology of host and pathogen both play role in organizing these collection trips. Pathogen infection is normally observed as sporulation events (at least in sporulating fungi and oomycetes) and if the sporulation is your only visible identification of the infected plants then one has to have enough knowledge about the epidemiology of the disease and host pathology. Because if you do not plan your trip with these factors taken into account then the whole endeavor might result in the failure. Better planning usually results in the success of such trips.

Here comes the utility of [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](www.gbif.org) (GBIF). GBIF has curated almost 2 billion occurrence records so far with species from almost every kingdom. I found it remarkable that not only it has extensive data on plant occurrences but also some plants' pathogens. One can now easily search the database for their favorite plant patho-system and see when and where people have observed the host plant and its pathogen. Of course recorded pathogen occurrences are slightly sparse for the good reason that  many records are submitted by the semi-amateur, hobbyist observers that might not necessarily have good training in plant pathology. Regardless, I found a lot of records for the *A. thaliana* and *H. arabidopsidis*, which is encouraging.

Clearly, the use of GBIF in preliminary scouting for the plants without leaving your home is immense. If used properly one can easily organize plant collection trips just using GBIF, with one additional consideration to take into account. As I stated earlier a lot of GBIF records are submitted by hobbyist, semi-amateur enthusiast. Although it might not matter for vertebrates or animals so much, most of the plant records that are submitted are based on the flower morphology and not the morphology of the vegetative state. It is understandable that to recognize plants from their leaf morphology would require extensive botany expertise (which I can't also claim to have), this way of plant identification overestimates the plant occurrence time. That overestimation might not be relevant for collection trips for plants alone, but for the plants that are potentially infected with biotrophic pathogen, **when** you sample is crucial to catch the right stage and depending on the objectives of the collection trip one can adjust the organization around the GBIF record. All in all, [GBIF](www.gbif.org) is a great resource and if you are planning to collect some flora and fauna for research or hobby definitely check it out (if you haven't already done so).
