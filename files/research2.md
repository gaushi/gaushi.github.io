      This is the Teeny Tiny plant I work on. I love to spends hours and days and...years just looking at it and falling in love with it.
    Every time I look at it I see a new shade of green. I mostly like to look for a white shade though. 
You might ask me how much do I love this teeny tiny thing; well I love it so much that at the end I KILL it :D :D :D
